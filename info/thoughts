From visual exploration I conclude that a lot of time windows are crappy.
Phases is definitely a better approach than time windows.

How to filter phases from data?
How to match the current phase to other phases?

Event data is very complex. Can't just take xy data to get a good picture.
Event type, team and outcome are important attributes
that can't be ignored when trying to capture gameplay knowledge!
Maybe filter certain events?
